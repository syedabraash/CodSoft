# Project 1: Simple Chatbot

Overview

In this project, I developed a straightforward chatbot using rule-based systems. The aim was to employ if-else statements and pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses, offering a glimpse into natural language processing and conversation flow.

Key Features

Pattern Matching: Utilized if-else statements and pattern matching to understand user queries.
Conversation Flow: Implemented a simple conversation flow to engage users and respond contextually.

Technologies Used

Python served as the primary programming language.
Libraries and frameworks included:
Regular expressions for pattern matching.

Learning Experience

This project provided hands-on experience in crafting a basic chatbot, understanding user intent through rule-based systems, and managing conversation flow. It served as a foundation for further exploration into natural language processing.


# Project 2: AI Tic Tac Toe 

Welcome to AI Tic Tac Toe! This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game where you can play against an intelligent AI opponent.

## Features

- Play against an AI with varying difficulty levels.
- Smart AI using the minimax algorithm for optimal moves.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.
- Supports command-line or graphical interface (based on your implementation).

AI Strategies

The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm:

Easy: Randomly selects an empty spot.
Medium: Prioritizes winning moves; random otherwise.
Hard: Implements minimax for optimal moves.


# Project 3: Face Detection

Overview

The Face Detection project involved the implementation of face detection using pre-trained models, specifically Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors. The goal was to develop a robust system capable of accurately detecting faces in images.

Key Features

Pre-trained Models: Utilized pre-trained models for efficient and accurate face detection.
Integration: Integrated the face detection functionality into an application for practical use.

Technologies Used

Python served as the primary programming language.
Libraries and frameworks included:
OpenCV for computer vision tasks.

Learning Experience

This project provided hands-on experience in implementing face detection using both traditional Haar cascades and deep learning-based models. It deepened my understanding of computer vision techniques and their applications.
